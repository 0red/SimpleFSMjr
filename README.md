# SimpleFSM

Arduino/ESP library to simplify setting up and running a state machinee.

* Author: Lennart Hennigs (<https://www.lennarthennigs.de>)
* Copyright (C) 2022 Lennart Hennigs.
* Released under the MIT license.

**Disclaimer**

* This library is not complete (yet) and a work in progress. 
* Some of the features mentioned below might not be done yet.
* This document is also not complete

## Description

* This library allows you to quickly setup a State Machine.
* Read here [what a state machine is]() and [why a state mache is neat for hardware projects]() TBD

### Features

* Easy state definition
* Allows for none, one or multiple final states
* Event triggered transitions and (automatic) timed transitions
* Possibility to define guard conditions for your transitions
* Callback functions for...
  * State entry, staying, exit
  * Transition execution
  * Final state reached
  * the run interval of the state machine
* Definition of an in_state intervall
* Functions for tracking the behaviour and progress of the state machine (TBD)
* Storage of the current state on files with `LittleFS` or SD card storage (TBD)
* Creation of a `Graphviz` source file of your state machine definition (TBD)
  
To see the latest changes to the library please take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## How To Use

* You first need to define a set of states for your state machine
* Then, define transitions (regular or timed) for these state
* Pass the transitions to your state machine
* Define an inital state
* ...and add the `run()` function in your loop
* See [SimpleTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) for a basic example

### Defining States

* A finite state machine has a defined set of states
* A state must have a name...
* ...and can have callback functions for different events (when a state is entered, exited, or stays in a state)
* Most states will have the entry handler
* The easiest way to define states is creating using an array, e.g. as shown in [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino):
  ```
  State s[] = {
    State("red",        on_red),
    State("green",      on_green),
    State("BTN",        on_button_press)
  };
  ```
* The inital state **must** of the state machine must be defined â€“ either via the constructor or the `setup()` function or via the `setInitialState()` function
* None, one, or multiple states can be defined as an end state via `setAsFinal()`
* For the full `State` class definition see [State.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/State.h)

### Transitions

* This library offers two types of Transitions, regular and timed ones
* All transitions must have a from and and a to state
* Transitions can have a callback function for when the transition is executed, a name, and a [guard condition](#guard-conditions)
* See [Transitions.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/Transitions.h) for the class definition of both transitiond. (Note: Both classes are based of an abstract class which is not to be used in your code.)
* You can add both types to a state machine, see [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) for an example

### Regular Transitions
* Regular transitions need to be manually triggered, e.g. through a button press:
  ```
  Transition transitions[] = {
    Transition(&s[0], &s[2], button_was_pressed)
  };
  ```
* Regular transitions must have a trigger (ID), above this is `button_was_pressed`
* It's easy to define triggeres in an enum:
  ```
  enum triggers {
    button_was_pressed = 1  
  };
  ```

* See [SimpleTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitions/SimpleTransitions.ino) and [SimpleTransitionWithButtons.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitionWithButton/SimpleTransitionWithButton.ino)

### Timed Transitions 
 
* Timed transitions are automatically executed after a certain amount of time
* The interval is defined in milliseconds
  ```
  TimedTransition timedTransitions[] = {
    TimedTransition(&s[0], &s[1], 6000),
    TimedTransition(&s[1], &s[0], 4000),
    TimedTransition(&s[2], &s[1], 2000)
  };
  ```
* See [TimedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/TimedTransitions/TimedTransitions.ino)

### Guard Conditions

* ...
* See [Guards.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/Guards/Guards.ino)

### In-State Interval

* ...

### Helper functions

* ...

## Class Definition

* [State.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/State.h)
* [Transitions.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/Transitions.h) for the class definition of both transitions
* [SimpleFSM](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/SimpleFSM.h)

## Examples

* [SimpleTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitions/SimpleTransitions.ino) - only regular transitions and showcasing the different events
* [SimpleTransitionWithButtons.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitionWithButton/SimpleTransitionWithButton.ino) - event is now triggered via a hardware button
* [TimedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/TimedTransitions/TimedTransitions.ino) - showcasing timed transitions
* [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) - regular and timed transitions
* [Guards.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/Guards/Guards.ino) - showing how to define guard functions

## Notes

* This libary is heavily inspiried by the [Arduino-fsm](https://github.com/jonblack/arduino-fsm) library created by [Jon Black](https://github.com/jonblack). I initally used some of his as a base. Without Jon's work this library would not exist.
* To see the latest changes to the library please take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
* And if you find this library helpful, please consider giving it a star at [GitHub](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM). Thanks!
